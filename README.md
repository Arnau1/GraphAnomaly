# Graph Anomaly Detection
The objective of this project is to address a graph-based anomaly detection problem, specifically focusing on identifying anomalous and fraudulent bitcoin transactions within a given dataset. Here you can find all the code that has been used:

- **Others:** In this folder, you can find the files that do not form part of the final delivery of code. They are notebooks that did not work or were substituted by more organized notebooks, among other causes.

- **Pipeline:** These are the numbered notebooks that contain the code of the project, sorted from the start where the dataset is processed until the more sophisticated models that have been trained and its interface. The **Helper.py** file contains multiple functions that the notebooks of the pipeline use.

*Note that the Elliptic dataset that has been used to develop the project cannot be uploaded because of its large size. It can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set>*

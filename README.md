# Graph Anomaly Detection
The objective of this project is to address a graph-based anomaly detection problem, specifically focusing on identifying anomalous and fraudulent bitcoin transactions within a given dataset. Here you can find all the code that has been used:

- **Pipeline:** In this folder, you can find the pipeline that have been used to construct this project, from the start of the project with processing the dataset, until the more sophisticated models that have been trained.

*Note that the Elliptic dataset that has been used to develop the project cannot be uploaded because of its large size. It can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set>*
